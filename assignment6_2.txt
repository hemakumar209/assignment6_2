Perform the below operations:
a. Is there any association between Job and default?
   Ans:
     >zip.url1<-"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/bank-additional.zip"
     >temp1<-tempfile()
     >download.file(zip.url1,temp1)
     >myfile<-data.frame(read.csv(unz(temp1,"bank-additional.csv"),sep = ";"))
     >head(myfile)

     >job<-as.numeric(myfile$job)
     >default<-as.numeric(myfile$default)
     >cor(job,default)

     >bartable = table(myfile$job, myfile$default)  
     >barplot(bartable, beside = TRUE, legend =levels(unique(myfile$job)))

    #allthe employes have default no and unknown only one employee is with yes


b. Is there any significant difference in duration of last call between people having housing loan or not?
   Ans:
    >ordering<-c("yes","no","unknown")
    > mydata$housing <- as.numeric(factor(myfile$housing , levels = ordering))
    > str(mydata)

    > aModel <- aov(housing ~ duration,data=mydata)
    > summary(aModel)
    >aModel$coefficients

    Result: 
                   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)
     duration       1    0.1 0.06864   0.228  0.633
     Residuals   4117 1239.7 0.30111

     Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1


c. Is there any association between consumer price index and consumer?

   ans:
     there is no association between consumer price index and consumer
     as there is no customer column in the data set



d. Is the employment variation rate consistent across job types?
  Ans:
    >bartable = table(myfile$emp.var.rate, myfile$job)  
    >barplot(bartable, beside = TRUE, legend =levels(unique(myfile$emp.var.rate)))

    # by seeing the plot we can say that  different jobs all the employees have 
      different employment variation rates they are not consistent across job types.

e. Is the employment variation rate same across education?
    Ans:
     >bartable = table(myfile$emp.var.rate , myfile$education)  
     >barplot(bartable, beside = TRUE, legend =levels(unique(myfile$emp.var.rate)))
   
     
    # by seeing the plot we can say that  different educations the employment variation rates   
      are different they are not same.
   
f. Which group is more confident??
  Ans:

     university.degree holders has more employment variation rates
     they are more confident
